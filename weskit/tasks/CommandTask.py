    """
    Run a command in a working directory. The workdir has to be an relative path, such that
    `base_workdir/sub_workdir` is the absolute path in which the command is executed. base_workdir
    can be absolute or relative.

    Write log files into a timestamp sub-directory of `sub_workdir/log_base`. There will be
    `stderr` and `stdout` files for the respective output of the command and `log.json` with
    general logging information, including the "command", "start_time", "end_time", and the
    "exit_code". Paths in the execution log are all relative.

    Returns a dict with fields "stdout_file", "stderr_file", "log_file" for the three log
    files, and "output_files" for all files created by the process, but not the three log-files.

    "exit_code" is set to -1, if no result could be produced from the command, e.g. if a prior
    mkdir failed, or similar abnormal situations.

    Note: The interface is not based on ShellCommand because that would have required a means of
          (de)serializing ShellCommand for transfer from the REST-server to the Celery worker.
